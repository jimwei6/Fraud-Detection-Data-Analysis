# Fraud Detection Analysis using KNN

## Introduction
Fraud detection is critical for audit companies and financial institutions to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of financial statements and transactions(Munter,2022). Fraudulent activities can result in significant financial losses and reputational damage for businesses and investors. Therefore, developing accurate and effective fraud detection models is crucial to identify potential fraud cases and risks. The main question we will try to answer in our project is: Can we accurately classify companies as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on our chosen predictors in the dataset? The dataset includes financial data, transactional data, company information, and external data. By leveraging this dataset, we can develop a classification model that learns patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent companies, enabling us to accurately predict and identify potential fraud cases in the future. In this project, we build a data pipeline and perform KNN classification in order to predict if a company is likely to be fraud.
